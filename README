You can build a node variation of this library using build/build.js : the resulting package will be in build/node.

## Use Node.JS port of Proj4JS ##
Without cloning this project you can use it directly using npm :
 npm install proj4js
 
In your JS :
 var Proj4js = require("proj4js");

## Exemple ##

 var Proj4js = require("proj4js"),
     proj = new Proj4js.Proj("");
     
console.log(Proj4js.transform(Proj4js.WGS84, proj, new Proj4js.Point([45,5])));

## Troubleshoot ##

Getting an error like this ?

  node.js:116
          throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick
          ^
  ReferenceError: document is not defined

As Proj4JS was targetting the browser, it tries to dynamically get any Projection that isn't yet defined. So you are probably just trying to use some not defined projection ;)

This may be fixed in a further revision

## "build" node.js version ##
 git clone git://github.com/temsa/node-proj4js.git
 cd node-proj4js
 cd build
 node ./build.js
 cd node # here is the resulting package !

then you can use it with npm link (see documentation) or do a
 npm install
